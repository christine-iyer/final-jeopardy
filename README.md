Updated a branch with another api.

### Practice What You Learned

* jService
* jService API
* jService is an API that has Jeopardy trivia questions and answers available to the public.

## Make a Jeopardy Trivia App using jService!

Problem Solving
ALLLLLLL MY STUDENTS ALWAYS end up being asked at some point in the interview process how to create a Todo List with Basic CRUD capability.

Creating New Todo Items

Reading/Seeing Todos

Updating Todos that have been created

Deleting Todos off the Page

This excercise provides step-by-step instructions for creating a simple React Todo List using React Hooks. It covers setting up the initial project, creating the React components and styling them, and using React Hooks to store and manipulate data. By the end, you will have a fully functional React Todo List.

Set up your project: First, create a new React project using the create-react-app command. Delete src folder, and then re-create it. Add Back in index.js, App.js, styles.css
Create a Todo component: Next, create a Todo component that will render a single todo item. This component should accept a todo object as a prop and display the todoâ€™s text and a checkbox to mark it as complete.
Create a TodoList component: Then, create a TodoList component that will render a list of todo items. This component should accept an array of todo objects as a prop, and loop through the array to render a Todo component for each item.
Use React Hooks: Next, use React Hooks to store and manipulate the data with UseState
Handle user interactions: Then, add event handlers to handle user interactions. For example, you can add an onChange handler to the checkbox to mark a todo as complete.
Add new todos: Add an input to the TodoList component so users can add new todos. This input should update the state when the user types enter.
Filter todos: Add a filter option to the TodoList component so users can filter todos by completed or incompleted.
Add persistence: To persist the data, you can use local storage. Add a function to save and retrieve the todos from local storage.
Add Delete Functionality to the Todo List
Add styling: Now, add some basic styling to the components.
Test and debug: Finally, test and debug the app to make sure everything is working correctly.
By following these steps, we will have a fully functional React Todo List.

### Sample Jeopardy Trivia App appearance

&#9744; Make a button labeled "Random Trivia Question" or "Get Question" or something descriptive.

&#9744; On click, have this button make a GETrequest to get random trivia data. Let's start you off with a win by giving you the URL: http://jservice.io/api/random

&#9744; Make some html elements like a divwhere you will display the question, category and points. NOTE: You will need to look at the data that is returned to you and think back about how to access data from different datatypes (is it an array within an object? How do you access the info?).

&#9744; Make another divin your HTML where you display the answer

&#9744; Add an on click function that toggles whether or not you can see the answer.

&#9744; Add other elements to your page to make it make sense and look good (see attached image)

&#9744; Make a divthat has an h2and two buttons

&#9744; Inside the h2keep score, start at 0

&#9744; Make one buttonadd the points to the score and the other to subtract points from the score (just add or subtract 100 points using the points value from jService is Hungry for More)

&#9744; Add a little style and color to your app


&#9744; Once Completed deploy using NPM RUN BUILD && Netlify

&#9744; This should be pushed to github as a repo. The repo is the deliverable.
 
&#9744; In the readme of your project link to your live Netlify link

### Hungry for More?

* jService+

&#9744; Use the points provided for the question to add and subtract from the score React docs: lifting state up

&#9744; Create a third buttonthat resets the score to 0

&#9744; Make another buttontitled Get 10 Questions.

&#9744; Make a request to get random trivia data that returns 10 items: ex: 'http://jservice.io/api/random?count=10'

&#9744; Use what you learned today to display all 10 of the questions.

&#9744; Include a button with each of the questions to reveal that will reveal the answer when clicked. (You may find it easy to reveal ALL the answers, revealing just the answer of one question is challenging!)

&#9744; Use the documentation to look at the categories that are available with jService. Choose 1. Make a request to get the trivia information for that category. Display them on your page in the same way as before (a question with an answer button);

&#9744; Research other APIs! Find one that looks interesting and make a "GET" request for some data.
